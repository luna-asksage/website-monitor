## Watch for Gemini 3 series models leaving Public Preview
- **Issue:** #29
- **Watch for:** Gemini 3 series models leaving Public Preview and become Generally Available (GA).
- **Why:** Preview models are only available in the global region. We are restricted to US regions only, so we cannot use these models until GA.
- **Sources:** gemini
- **Expires:** 2026-07-13 (163 days remaining)
