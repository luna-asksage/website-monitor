DATE: Mon, 18 Jul 2022 GMT --- TITLE: DALLE 2: Extending creativity DESCRIPTION: As part of our DALLE 2 research preview, more than 3,000 artists from more than 118 countries have incorporated DALLE into their creative workflows. The artists in our early access group have helped us discover new uses for DALLE and have served as key voices as weve made decisions about DALLEs features. DATE: Thu, 14 Jul 2022 GMT --- TITLE: DALLE 2 pre-training mitigations DESCRIPTION: In order to share the magic of DALLE 2 with a broad audience, we needed to reduce the risks associated with powerful image generation models. To this end, we put various guardrails in place to prevent generated images from violating our content policy. DATE: Tue, 28 Jun 2022 GMT --- TITLE: Learning to play Minecraft with Video PreTraining DESCRIPTION: We trained a neural network to play Minecraft by Video PreTraining (VPT) on a massive unlabeled video dataset of human Minecraft play, while using only a small amount of labeled contractor data. With fine-tuning, our model can learn to craft diamond tools, a task that usually takes proficient humans over 20 minutes (24,000 actions). Our model uses the native human interface of keypresses and mouse movements, making it quite general, and represents a step towards general computer-using agents. DATE: Thu, 23 Jun 2022 GMT --- TITLE: Evolution through large models DATE: Fri, 17 Jun 2022 GMT --- TITLE: AI-written critiques help humans notice flaws DESCRIPTION: We trained critique-writing models to describe flaws in summaries. Human evaluators find flaws in summaries much more often when shown our models critiques. Larger models are better at self-critiquing, with scale improving critique-writing more than summary-writing. This shows promise for using AI systems to assist human supervision of AI systems on difficult tasks. DATE: Mon, 13 Jun 2022 GMT --- TITLE: Techniques for training large neural networks DESCRIPTION: Large neural networks are at the core of many recent advances in AI, but training them is a difficult engineering and research challenge which requires orchestrating a cluster of GPUs to perform a single synchronized calculation.

DATE: Thu, 05 May 2022 GMT --- TITLE: Hierarchical text-conditional image generation with CLIP latents DATE: Wed, 13 Apr 2022 GMT --- TITLE: Measuring Goodharts law DESCRIPTION: Goodharts law famously says: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. Although originally from economics, its something we have to grapple with at OpenAI when figuring out how to optimize objectives that are difficult or costly to measure. DATE: Wed, 13 Apr 2022 GMT --- TITLE: New GPT-3 capabilities: Edit & insert DESCRIPTION: Weve released new versions of GPT-3 and Codex which can edit or insert content into existing text, rather than just completing existing text. DATE: Tue, 15 Mar 2022 GMT --- TITLE: A research agenda for assessing the economic impacts of code generation models DATE: Thu, 03 Mar 2022 GMT --- TITLE: Lessons learned on language model safety and misuse DESCRIPTION: We describe our latest thinking in the hope of helping other AI developers address safety and misuse of deployed models.

DATE: Wed, 02 Feb 2022 GMT --- TITLE: Aligning language models to follow instructions DESCRIPTION: Weve trained language models that are much better at following user intentions than GPT-3 while also making them more truthful and less toxic, using techniques developed through our alignment research. These InstructGPT models, which are trained with humans in the loop, are now deployed as the default language models on our API. DATE: Thu, 27 Jan 2022 GMT --- TITLE: Introducing text and code embeddings DESCRIPTION: We are introducing embeddings, a new endpoint in the OpenAI API that makes it easy to perform natural language and code tasks like semantic search, clustering, topic modeling, and classification. DATE: Tue, 25 Jan 2022 GMT --- TITLE: Text and code embeddings by contrastive pre-training DATE: Mon, 24 Jan 2022 GMT --- TITLE: WebGPT: Improving the factual accuracy of language models through web browsing DESCRIPTION: Weve fine-tuned GPT-3 to more accurately answer open-ended questions using a text-based web browser.

DATE: Thu, 18 Nov 2021 GMT --- TITLE: Solving math word problems DESCRIPTION: Weve trained a system that solves grade school math problems with nearly twice the accuracy of a fine-tuned GPT-3 model. It solves about 90% as many problems as real kids: a small sample of 9-12 year olds scored 60% on a test from our dataset, while our system scored 55% on those same problems. DATE: Fri, 29 Oct 2021 GMT --- TITLE: Summarizing books with human feedback DESCRIPTION: Scaling human oversight of AI systems for tasks that are difficult to evaluate.

So, were delighted to announce that Congressman Will Hurd has joined our board of directors. DATE: Mon, 03 May 2021 GMT --- TITLE: GPT-3 powers the next generation of apps DESCRIPTION: Over 300 applications are delivering GPT-3powered search, conversation, text completion, and other advanced AI features through our API. DATE: Thu, 25 Mar 2021 GMT --- TITLE: Multimodal neurons in artificial neural networks DESCRIPTION: Weve discovered neurons in CLIP that respond to the same concept whether presented literally, symbolically, or conceptually. This may explain CLIPs accuracy in classifying surprising visual renditions of concepts, and is also an important step toward understanding the associations and biases that CLIP and similar models learn. DATE: Thu, 04 Mar 2021 GMT --- TITLE: Understanding the capabilities, limitations, and societal impact of large language models DATE: Thu, 04 Feb 2021 GMT --- TITLE: Scaling Kubernetes to 7,500 nodes DESCRIPTION: Weve scaled Kubernetes clusters to 7,500 nodes, producing a scalable infrastructure for large models like GPT-3, CLIP, and DALLE, but also for rapid small-scale iterative research such as Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models. DATE: Mon, 25 Jan 2021 GMT --- TITLE: DALLE: Creating images from text DESCRIPTION: Weve trained a neural network called DALLE that creates images from text captions for a wide range of concepts expressible in natural language. DATE: Tue, 05 Jan 2021 GMT --- TITLE: CLIP: Connecting text and images DESCRIPTION: Were introducing a neural network called CLIP which efficiently learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. CLIP can be applied to any visual classification benchmark by simply providing the names of the visual categories to be recognized, similar to the zero-shot capabilities of GPT-2 and GPT-3. DATE: Tue, 05 Jan 2021 GMT --- TITLE: Organizational update from OpenAI DESCRIPTION: Its been a year of dramatic change and growth at OpenAI.

DATE: Sat, 20 Jun 2020 GMT --- TITLE: Image GPT DESCRIPTION: We find that, just as a large transformer model trained on language can generate coherent text, the same exact model trained on pixel sequences can generate coherent image completions and samples. By establishing a correlation between sample quality and image classification accuracy, we show that our best generative model also contains features competitive with top convolutional nets in the unsupervised setting. DATE: Wed, 17 Jun 2020 GMT --- TITLE: OpenAI API DESCRIPTION: Were releasing an API for accessing new AI models developed by OpenAI. DATE: Thu, 11 Jun 2020 GMT --- TITLE: Language models are few-shot learners DATE: Thu, 28 May 2020 GMT --- TITLE: AI and efficiency DESCRIPTION: Were releasing an analysis showing that since 2012 the amount of compute needed to train a neural net to the same performance on ImageNet classification has been decreasing by a factor of 2 every 16 months. Compared to 2012, it now takes 44 times less compute to train a neural network to the level of AlexNet (by contrast, Moores Law would yield an 11x cost improvement over this period). Our results suggest that for AI tasks with high levels of recent investment, algorithmic progress has yielded more gains than classical hardware efficiency. DATE: Tue, 05 May 2020 GMT --- TITLE: Jukebox DESCRIPTION: Were introducing Jukebox, a neural net that generates music, including rudimentary singing, as raw audio in a variety of genres and artist styles. Were releasing the model weights and code, along with a tool to explore the generated samples. DATE: Thu, 30 Apr 2020 GMT --- TITLE: Improving verifiability in AI development DESCRIPTION: Weve contributed to a multi-stakeholder report by 58 co-authors at 30 organizations, including the Centre for the Future of Intelligence, Mila, Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and Center for Security and Emerging Technologies. This report describes 10 mechanisms to improve the verifiability of claims made about AI systems. Developers can use these tools to provide evidence that AI systems are safe, secure, fair, or privacy-preserving. Users, policymakers, and civil society can use these tools to evaluate AI development processes. DATE: Thu, 16 Apr 2020 GMT --- TITLE: OpenAI Microscope DESCRIPTION: Were introducing OpenAI Microscope, a collection of visualizations of every significant layer and neuron of eight vision model organisms which are often studied in interpretability. Microscope makes it easier to analyze the features that form inside these neural networks, and we hope it will help the research community as we move towards understanding these complicated systems. DATE: Tue, 14 Apr 2020 GMT --- TITLE: OpenAI standardizes on PyTorch DESCRIPTION: We are standardizing OpenAIs deep learning framework on PyTorch. DATE: Thu, 30 Jan 2020 GMT --- TITLE: Scaling laws for neural language models DATE: Thu, 23 Jan 2020 GMT --- TITLE: Dota 2 with large scale deep reinforcement learning DATE: Fri, 13 Dec 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Deep double descent DESCRIPTION: We show that the double descent phenomenon occurs in CNNs, ResNets, and transformers: performance first improves, then gets worse, and then improves again with increasing model size, data size, or training time. This effect is often avoided through careful regularization. While this behavior appears to be fairly universal, we dont yet fully understand why it happens, and view further study of this phenomenon as an important research direction. DATE: Thu, 05 Dec 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Procgen Benchmark DESCRIPTION: Were releasing Procgen Benchmark, 16 simple-to-use procedurally-generated environments which provide a direct measure of how quickly a reinforcement learning agent learns generalizable skills. DATE: Tue, 03 Dec 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Benchmarking safe exploration in deep reinforcement learning DATE: Thu, 21 Nov 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Safety Gym DESCRIPTION: Were releasing Safety Gym, a suite of environments and tools for measuring progress towards reinforcement learning agents that respect safety constraints while training. DATE: Thu, 21 Nov 2019 GMT --- TITLE: GPT-2: 1.5B release DESCRIPTION: As the final model release of GPT-2s staged release, were releasing the largest version (1.5B parameters) of GPT-2 along with code and model weights to facilitate detection of outputs of GPT-2 models. While there have been larger language models released since August, weve continued with our original staged release plan in order to provide the community with a test case of a full staged release process. We hope that this test case will be useful to developers of future powerful models, and were actively continuing the conversation with the AI community on responsible publication. DATE: Tue, 05 Nov 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Solving Rubiks Cube with a robot hand DESCRIPTION: Weve trained a pair of neural networks to solve the Rubiks Cube with a human-like robot hand. The neural networks are trained entirely in simulation, using the same reinforcement learning code as OpenAI Five paired with a new technique called Automatic Domain Randomization (ADR). The system can handle situations it never saw during training, such as being prodded by a stuffed giraffe. This shows that reinforcement learning isnt just a tool for virtual tasks, but can solve physical-world problems requiring unprecedented dexterity. DATE: Tue, 15 Oct 2019 GMT --- TITLE: OpenAI Scholars 2020: Applications open DESCRIPTION: We are now accepting applications for our third class of OpenAI Scholars. DATE: Fri, 11 Oct 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Fine-tuning GPT-2 from human preferences DESCRIPTION: Weve fine-tuned the 774M parameter GPT-2 language model using human feedback for various tasks, successfully matching the preferences of the external human labelers, though those preferences did not always match our own. Specifically, for summarization tasks the labelers preferred sentences copied wholesale from the input (wed only asked them to ensure accuracy), so our models learned to copy. Summarization required 60k human labels; simpler tasks which continue text in various styles required only 5k. Our motivation is to move safety techniques closer to the general task of machines talking to humans, which we believe is key to extracting information about human values. DATE: Thu, 19 Sep 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Emergent tool use from multi-agent interaction DESCRIPTION: Weve observed agents discovering progressively more complex tool use while playing a simple game of hide-and-seek. Through training in our new simulated hide-and-seek environment, agents build a series of six distinct strategies and counterstrategies, some of which we did not know our environment supported. The self-supervised emergent complexity in this simple environment further suggests that multi-agent co-adaptation may one day produce extremely complex and intelligent behavior. DATE: Tue, 17 Sep 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Testing robustness against unforeseen adversaries DESCRIPTION: Weve developed a method to assess whether a neural network classifier can reliably defend against adversarial attacks not seen during training. Our method yields a new metric, UAR (Unforeseen Attack Robustness), which evaluates the robustness of a single model against an unanticipated attack, and highlights the need to measure performance across a more diverse range of unforeseen attacks. DATE: Thu, 22 Aug 2019 GMT --- TITLE: GPT-2: 6-month follow-up DESCRIPTION: Were releasing the 774 million parameter GPT-2 language model after the release of our small 124M model in February, staged release of our medium 355M model in May, and subsequent research with partners and the AI community into the models potential for misuse and societal benefit. Were also releasing an open-source legal agreement to make it easier for organizations to initiate model-sharing partnerships with each other, and are publishing a technical report about our experience in coordinating with the wider AI research community on publication norms. DATE: Tue, 20 Aug 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Learning Day DESCRIPTION: At OpenAI, each Thursday is Learning Day: a day where employees have the option to self-study technical skills that will make them better at their job but which arent being learned from daily work. DATE: Thu, 01 Aug 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Microsoft invests in and partners with OpenAI to support us building beneficial AGI DESCRIPTION: Microsoft is investing $1 billion in OpenAI to support us building artificial general intelligence (AGI) with widely distributed economic benefits. Were partnering to develop a hardware and software platform within Microsoft Azure which will scale to AGI. Well jointly develop new Azure AI supercomputing technologies, and Microsoft will become our exclusive cloud providerso well be working hard together to further extend Microsoft Azures capabilities in large-scale AI systems. DATE: Mon, 22 Jul 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Why responsible AI development needs cooperation on safety DESCRIPTION: Weve written a policy research paper identifying four strategies that can be used today to improve the likelihood of long-term industry cooperation on safety norms in AI: communicating risks and benefits, technical collaboration, increased transparency, and incentivizing standards. Our analysis shows that industry cooperation on safety will be instrumental in ensuring that AI systems are safe and beneficial, but competitive pressures could lead to a collective action problem, potentially causing AI companies to under-invest in safety. We hope these strategies will encourage greater cooperation on the safe development of AI and lead to better global outcomes of AI. DATE: Wed, 10 Jul 2019 GMT --- TITLE: OpenAI Robotics Symposium 2019 DESCRIPTION: We hosted the first OpenAI Robotics Symposium on April 27, 2019.

We are currently reviewing applications on a rolling basis for our next round of OpenAI Fellows Summer 2019. DATE: Fri, 17 May 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Transfer of adversarial robustness between perturbation types DATE: Fri, 03 May 2019 GMT --- TITLE: MuseNet DESCRIPTION: Weve created MuseNet, a deep neural network that can generate 4-minute musical compositions with 10 different instruments, and can combine styles from country to Mozart to the Beatles. MuseNet was not explicitly programmed with our understanding of music, but instead discovered patterns of harmony, rhythm, and style by learning to predict the next token in hundreds of thousands of MIDI files. MuseNet uses the same general-purpose unsupervised technology as GPT-2, a large-scale transformer model trained to predict the next token in a sequence, whether audio or text. DATE: Thu, 25 Apr 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Generative modeling with sparse transformers DESCRIPTION: Weve developed the Sparse Transformer, a deep neural network which sets new records at predicting what comes next in a sequencewhether text, images, or sound. It uses an algorithmic improvement of the attention mechanism to extract patterns from sequences 30x longer than possible previously. DATE: Tue, 23 Apr 2019 GMT --- TITLE: OpenAI Five defeats Dota 2 world champions DESCRIPTION: OpenAI Five is the first AI to beat the world champions in an esports game, having won two back-to-back games versus the world champion Dota 2 team, OG, at Finals this weekend. Both OpenAI Five and DeepMinds AlphaStar had previously beaten good pros privately but lost their live pro matches, making this also the first time an AI has beaten esports pros on livestream. DATE: Mon, 15 Apr 2019 GMT --- TITLE: OpenAI Five Finals DESCRIPTION: Well be holding our final live event for OpenAI Five at PT on April 13. DATE: Tue, 26 Mar 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Implicit generation and generalization methods for energy-based models DESCRIPTION: Weve made progress towards stable and scalable training of energy-based models (EBMs) resulting in better sample quality and generalization ability than existing models. Generation in EBMs spends more compute to continually refine its answers and doing so can generate samples competitive with GANs at low temperatures, while also having mode coverage guarantees of likelihood-based models. We hope these findings stimulate further research into this promising class of models. DATE: Thu, 21 Mar 2019 GMT --- TITLE: OpenAI Scholars 2019: Meet our Scholars DESCRIPTION: Our class of eight scholars (out of 550 applicants) brings together collective expertise in literature, philosophy, cell biology, statistics, economics, quantum physics, and business innovation. DATE: Wed, 13 Mar 2019 GMT --- TITLE: OpenAI LP DESCRIPTION: Weve created OpenAI LP, a new capped-profit company that allows us to rapidly increase our investments in compute and talent while including checks and balances to actualize our mission. DATE: Mon, 11 Mar 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Introducing Activation Atlases DESCRIPTION: Weve created activation atlases (in collaboration with Google researchers), a new technique for visualizing what interactions between neurons can represent. As AI systems are deployed in increasingly sensitive contexts, having a better understanding of their internal decision-making processes will let us identify weaknesses and investigate failures. DATE: Wed, 06 Mar 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Neural MMO: A massively multiagent game environment DESCRIPTION: Were releasing a Neural MMO, a massively multiagent game environment for reinforcement learning agents. Our platform supports a large, variable number of agents within a persistent and open-ended task. The inclusion of many agents and species leads to better exploration, divergent niche formation, and greater overall competence. DATE: Mon, 04 Mar 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Spinning Up in Deep RL: Workshop review DESCRIPTION: On February 2, we held our first Spinning Up Workshop as part of our new education initiative at OpenAI. DATE: Tue, 26 Feb 2019 GMT --- TITLE: AI safety needs social scientists DESCRIPTION: Weve written a paper arguing that long-term AI safety research needs social scientists to ensure AI alignment algorithms succeed when actual humans are involved. Properly aligning advanced AI systems with human values requires resolving many uncertainties related to the psychology of human rationality, emotion, and biases. The aim of this paper is to spark further collaboration between machine learning and social science researchers, and we plan to hire social scientists to work on this full time at OpenAI. DATE: Tue, 19 Feb 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Better language models and their implications DESCRIPTION: Weve trained a large-scale unsupervised language model which generates coherent paragraphs of text, achieves state-of-the-art performance on many language modeling benchmarks, and performs rudimentary reading comprehension, machine translation, question answering, and summarizationall without task-specific training. DATE: Thu, 14 Feb 2019 GMT --- TITLE: Computational limitations in robust classification and win-win results DATE: Mon, 04 Feb 2019 GMT --- TITLE: OpenAI Fellows Summer 2018: Final projects DESCRIPTION: Our first cohort of OpenAI Fellows has concluded, with each Fellow going from a machine learning beginner to core OpenAI contributor in the course of a 6-month apprenticeship. DATE: Wed, 19 Dec 2018 GMT --- TITLE: How AI training scales DESCRIPTION: Weve discovered that the gradient noise scale, a simple statistical metric, predicts the parallelizability of neural network training on a wide range of tasks. Since complex tasks tend to have noisier gradients, increasingly large batch sizes are likely to become useful in the future, removing one potential limit to further growth of AI systems. More broadly, these results show that neural network training need not be considered a mysterious art, but can be rigorized and systematized. DATE: Fri, 14 Dec 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Quantifying generalization in reinforcement learning DESCRIPTION: Were releasing CoinRun, a training environment which provides a metric for an agents ability to transfer its experience to novel situations and has already helped clarify a longstanding puzzle in reinforcement learning. CoinRun strikes a desirable balance in complexity: the environment is simpler than traditional platformer games like Sonic the Hedgehog but still poses a worthy generalization challenge for state of the art algorithms. DATE: Thu, 06 Dec 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Spinning Up in Deep RL DESCRIPTION: Were releasing Spinning Up in Deep RL, an educational resource designed to let anyone learn to become a skilled practitioner in deep reinforcement learning. Spinning Up consists of crystal-clear examples of RL code, educational exercises, documentation, and tutorials. DATE: Thu, 08 Nov 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Learning concepts with energy functions DESCRIPTION: Weve developed an energy-based model that can quickly learn to identify and generate instances of concepts, such as near, above, between, closest, and furthest, expressed as sets of 2d points. Our model learns these concepts after only five demonstrations. We also show cross-domain transfer: we use concepts learned in a 2d particle environment to solve tasks on a 3-dimensional physics-based robot. DATE: Wed, 07 Nov 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Plan online, learn offline: Efficient learning and exploration via model-based control DATE: Mon, 05 Nov 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Reinforcement learning with prediction-based rewards DESCRIPTION: Weve developed Random Network Distillation (RND), a prediction-based method for encouraging reinforcement learning agents to explore their environments through curiosity, which for the first time exceeds average human performance on Montezumas Revenge. DATE: Wed, 31 Oct 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Learning complex goals with iterated amplification DESCRIPTION: Were proposing an AI safety technique called iterated amplification that lets us specify complicated behaviors and goals that are beyond human scale, by demonstrating how to decompose a task into simpler sub-tasks, rather than by providing labeled data or a reward function. Although this idea is in its very early stages and we have only completed experiments on simple toy algorithmic domains, weve decided to present it in its preliminary state because we think it could prove to be a scalable approach to AI safety. DATE: Mon, 22 Oct 2018 GMT --- TITLE: OpenAI Scholars 2019: Applications open DESCRIPTION: We are now accepting applications for our second cohort of OpenAI Scholars, a program where we provide 610 stipends and mentorship to individuals from underrepresented groups to study deep learning full-time for 3 months and open-source a project.

It extends previous work on reversible generative models and simplifies the architecture. Our model can generate realistic high resolution images, supports efficient sampling, and discovers features that can be used to manipulate attributes of data. Were releasing code for the model and an online visualization tool so people can explore and build on these results. DATE: Mon, 09 Jul 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Learning Montezumas Revenge from a single demonstration DESCRIPTION: Weve trained an agent to achieve a high score of 74,500 on Montezumas Revenge from a single human demonstration, better than any previously published result. Our algorithm is simple: the agent plays a sequence of games starting from carefully chosen states from the demonstration, and learns from them by optimizing the game score using PPO, the same reinforcement learning algorithm that underpins OpenAI Five. DATE: Wed, 04 Jul 2018 GMT --- TITLE: OpenAI Five DESCRIPTION: Our team of five neural networks, OpenAI Five, has started to defeat amateur human teams at Dota 2. DATE: Mon, 25 Jun 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Retro Contest: Results DESCRIPTION: The first run of our Retro Contestexploring the development of algorithms that can generalize from previous experienceis now complete. DATE: Fri, 22 Jun 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Learning policy representations in multiagent systems DATE: Sun, 17 Jun 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Improving language understanding with unsupervised learning DESCRIPTION: Weve obtained state-of-the-art results on a suite of diverse language tasks with a scalable, task-agnostic system, which were also releasing. Our approach is a combination of two existing ideas: transformers and unsupervised pre-training. These results provide a convincing example that pairing supervised learning methods with unsupervised pre-training works very well; this is an idea that many have explored in the past, and we hope our result motivates further research into applying this idea on larger and more diverse datasets. DATE: Mon, 11 Jun 2018 GMT --- TITLE: GamePad: A learning environment for theorem proving DATE: Sat, 02 Jun 2018 GMT --- TITLE: OpenAI Fellows Fall 2018 DESCRIPTION: Were now accepting applications for the next cohort of OpenAI Fellows, a program which offers a compensated 6-month apprenticeship in AI research at OpenAI.

This brings our publicly-released game count from around 70 Atari games and 30 Sega games to over 1,000 games across a variety of backing emulators. Were also releasing the tool we use to add new games to the platform. DATE: Fri, 25 May 2018 GMT --- TITLE: AI and compute DESCRIPTION: Were releasing an analysis showing that since 2012, the amount of compute used in the largest AI training runs has been increasing exponentially with a 3.4-month doubling time (by comparison, Moores Law had a 2-year doubling period)[^footnote-correction]. Since 2012, this metric has grown by more than 300,000x (a 2-year doubling period would yield only a 7x increase). Improvements in compute have been a key component of AI progress, so as long as this trend continues, its worth preparing for the implications of systems far outside todays capabilities. DATE: Wed, 16 May 2018 GMT --- TITLE: AI safety via debate DESCRIPTION: Were proposing an AI safety technique which trains agents to debate topics with one another, using a human to judge who wins. DATE: Thu, 03 May 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Evolved Policy Gradients DESCRIPTION: Were releasing an experimental metalearning approach called Evolved Policy Gradients, a method that evolves the loss function of learning agents, which can enable fast training on novel tasks. Agents trained with EPG can succeed at basic tasks at test time that were outside their training regime, like learning to navigate to an object on a different side of the room from where it was placed during training. DATE: Wed, 18 Apr 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Gotta Learn Fast: A new benchmark for generalization in RL DATE: Tue, 10 Apr 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Retro Contest DESCRIPTION: Were launching a transfer learning contest that measures a reinforcement learning algorithms ability to generalize from previous experience. DATE: Thu, 05 Apr 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Variance reduction for policy gradient with action-dependent factorized baselines DATE: Tue, 20 Mar 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Report from the OpenAI hackathon DESCRIPTION: On March 3rd, we hosted our first hackathon with 100 members of the artificial intelligence community. DATE: Thu, 15 Mar 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Improving GANs using optimal transport DATE: Thu, 15 Mar 2018 GMT --- TITLE: On first-order meta-learning algorithms DATE: Thu, 08 Mar 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Reptile: A scalable meta-learning algorithm DESCRIPTION: Weve developed a simple meta-learning algorithm called Reptile which works by repeatedly sampling a task, performing stochastic gradient descent on it, and updating the initial parameters towards the final parameters learned on that task. Reptile is the application of the Shortest Descent algorithm to the meta-learning setting, and is mathematically similar to first-order MAML (which is a version of the well-known MAML algorithm) that only needs black-box access to an optimizer such as SGD or Adam, with similar computational efficiency and performance. DATE: Wed, 07 Mar 2018 GMT --- TITLE: OpenAI Scholars DESCRIPTION: Were providing 610 stipends and mentorship to individuals from underrepresented groups to study deep learning full-time for 3 months and open-source a project. DATE: Tue, 06 Mar 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Some considerations on learning to explore via meta-reinforcement learning DATE: Sat, 03 Mar 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Ingredients for robotics research DESCRIPTION: Were releasing eight simulated robotics environments and a Baselines implementation of Hindsight Experience Replay, all developed for our research over the past year. Weve used these environments to train models which work on physical robots. Were also releasing a set of requests for robotics research. DATE: Mon, 26 Feb 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Multi-Goal Reinforcement Learning: Challenging robotics environments and request for research DATE: Mon, 26 Feb 2018 GMT --- TITLE: OpenAI hackathon DESCRIPTION: Come to OpenAIs office in San Franciscos Mission District for talks and a hackathon on Saturday, March 3rd. DATE: Thu, 22 Feb 2018 GMT --- TITLE: OpenAI supporters DESCRIPTION: Were excited to welcome new donors to OpenAI. DATE: Tue, 20 Feb 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Preparing for malicious uses of AI DESCRIPTION: Weve co-authored a paper that forecasts how malicious actors could misuse AI technology, and potential ways we can prevent and mitigate these threats. This paper is the outcome of almost a year of sustained work with our colleagues at the Future of Humanity Institute, the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, the Center for a New American Security, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and others. DATE: Tue, 20 Feb 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Interpretable machine learning through teaching DESCRIPTION: Weve designed a method that encourages AIs to teach each other with examples that also make sense to humans. Our approach automatically selects the most informative examples to teach a conceptfor instance, the best images to describe the concept of dogsand experimentally we found our approach to be effective at teaching both AIs DATE: Thu, 15 Feb 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Discovering types for entity disambiguation DESCRIPTION: Weve built a system for automatically figuring out which object is meant by a word by having a neural network decide if the word belongs to each of about 100 automatically-discovered types (non-exclusive categories). DATE: Wed, 07 Feb 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Requests for Research 2.0 DESCRIPTION: Were releasing a new batch of seven unsolved problems which have come up in the course of our research at OpenAI. DATE: Wed, 31 Jan 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Scaling Kubernetes to 2,500 nodes DATE: Thu, 18 Jan 2018 GMT --- TITLE: Block-sparse GPU kernels DESCRIPTION: Were releasing highly-optimized GPU kernels for an underexplored class of neural network architectures: networks with block-sparse weights. Depending on the chosen sparsity, these kernels can run orders of magnitude faster than cuBLAS or cuSPARSE. Weve used them to attain state-of-the-art results in text sentiment analysis and generative modeling of text and images. DATE: Wed, 06 Dec 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Learning sparse neural networks through L regularization DATE: Mon, 04 Dec 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Interpretable and pedagogical examples DATE: Thu, 02 Nov 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Learning a hierarchy DESCRIPTION: Weve developed a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm that learns high-level actions useful for solving a range of tasks, allowing fast solving of tasks requiring thousands of timesteps. Our algorithm, when applied to a set of navigation problems, discovers a set of high-level actions for walking and crawling in different directions, which enables the agent to master new navigation tasks quickly. DATE: Thu, 26 Oct 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Generalizing from simulation DESCRIPTION: Our latest robotics techniques allow robot controllers, trained entirely in simulation and deployed on physical robots, to react to unplanned changes in the environment as they solve simple tasks. That is, weve used these techniques to build closed-loop systems rather than open-loop ones as before. DATE: Thu, 19 Oct 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Asymmetric actor critic for image-based robot learning DATE: Wed, 18 Oct 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Sim-to-real transfer of robotic control with dynamics randomization DATE: Wed, 18 Oct 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Domain randomization and generative models for robotic grasping DATE: Tue, 17 Oct 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Meta-learning for wrestling DESCRIPTION: We show that for the task of simulated robot wrestling, a meta-learning agent can learn to quickly defeat a stronger non-meta-learning agent, and also show that the meta-learning agent can adapt to physical malfunction. DATE: Wed, 11 Oct 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Competitive self-play DESCRIPTION: Weve found that self-play allows simulated AIs to discover physical skills like tackling, ducking, faking, kicking, catching, and diving for the ball, without explicitly designing an environment with these skills in mind. Self-play ensures that the environment is always the right difficulty for an AI to improve. Taken alongside our Dota 2 self-play results, we have increasing confidence that self-play will be a core part of powerful AI systems in the future. DATE: Wed, 11 Oct 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Nonlinear computation in deep linear networks DATE: Fri, 29 Sep 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Learning to model other minds DESCRIPTION: Were releasing an algorithm which accounts for the fact that other agents are learning too, and discovers self-interested yet collaborative strategies like tit-for-tat in the iterated prisoners dilemma. This algorithm, Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), is a small step towards agents that model other minds. DATE: Thu, 14 Sep 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Learning with opponent-learning awareness DATE: Wed, 13 Sep 2017 GMT --- TITLE: OpenAI Baselines: ACKTR & A2C DESCRIPTION: Were releasing two new OpenAI Baselines implementations: ACKTR and A2C. A2C is a synchronous, deterministic variant of Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) which weve found gives equal performance. ACKTR is a more sample-efficient reinforcement learning algorithm than TRPO and A2C, and requires only slightly more computation than A2C per update. DATE: Fri, 18 Aug 2017 GMT --- TITLE: More on Dota 2 DESCRIPTION: Our Dota 2 result shows that self-play can catapult the performance of machine learning systems from far below human level to superhuman, given sufficient compute. In the span of a month, our system went from barely matching a high-ranked player to beating the top pros and has continued to improve since then. Supervised deep learning systems can only be as good as their training datasets, but in self-play systems, the available data improves automatically as the agent gets better. DATE: Wed, 16 Aug 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Dota 2 DESCRIPTION: Weve created a bot which beats the worlds top professionals at 1v1 matches of Dota 2 under standard tournament rules. The bot learned the game from scratch by self-play, and does not use imitation learning or tree search. This is a step towards building AI systems which accomplish well-defined goals in messy, complicated situations involving real humans. DATE: Fri, 11 Aug 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Gathering human feedback DESCRIPTION: RL-Teacher is an open-source implementation of our interface to train AIs via occasional human feedback rather than hand-crafted reward functions. The underlying technique was developed as a step towards safe AI systems, but also applies to reinforcement learning problems with rewards that are hard to specify. DATE: Thu, 03 Aug 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Better exploration with parameter noise DESCRIPTION: Weve found that adding adaptive noise to the parameters of reinforcement learning algorithms frequently boosts performance. This exploration method is simple to implement and very rarely decreases performance, so its worth trying on any problem. DATE: Thu, 27 Jul 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Proximal Policy Optimization DESCRIPTION: Were releasing a new class of reinforcement learning algorithms, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which perform comparably or better than state-of-the-art approaches while being much simpler to implement and tune. PPO has become the default reinforcement learning algorithm at OpenAI because of its ease of use and good performance. DATE: Thu, 20 Jul 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Robust adversarial inputs DESCRIPTION: Weve created images that reliably fool neural network classifiers when viewed from varied scales and perspectives. This challenges a claim from last week that self-driving cars would be hard to trick maliciously since they capture images from multiple scales, angles, perspectives, and the like. DATE: Mon, 17 Jul 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Hindsight Experience Replay DATE: Wed, 05 Jul 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Teacherstudent curriculum learning DATE: Sat, 01 Jul 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Faster physics in Python DESCRIPTION: Were open-sourcing a high-performance Python library for robotic simulation using the MuJoCo engine, developed over our past year of robotics research. DATE: Wed, 28 Jun 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Learning from human preferences DESCRIPTION: One step towards building safe AI systems is to remove the need for humans to write goal functions, since using a simple proxy for a complex goal, or getting the complex goal a bit wrong, can lead to undesirable and even dangerous behavior. In collaboration with DeepMinds safety team, weve developed an algorithm which can infer what humans want by being told which of two proposed behaviors is better. DATE: Tue, 13 Jun 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Learning to cooperate, compete, and communicate DESCRIPTION: Multiagent environments where agents compete for resources are stepping stones on the path to AGI. Multiagent environments have two useful properties: first, there is a natural curriculumthe difficulty of the environment is determined by the skill of your competitors (and if youre competing against clones of yourself, the environment exactly matches your skill level). Second, a multiagent environment has no stable equilibrium: no matter how smart an agent is, theres always pressure to get smarter. These environments have a very different feel from traditional environments, and itll take a lot more research before we become good at them. DATE: Thu, 08 Jun 2017 GMT --- TITLE: UCB exploration via Q-ensembles DATE: Mon, 05 Jun 2017 GMT --- TITLE: OpenAI Baselines: DQN DESCRIPTION: Were open-sourcing OpenAI Baselines, our internal effort to reproduce reinforcement learning algorithms with performance on par with published results.

DATE: Thu, 06 Apr 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Spam detection in the physical world DESCRIPTION: Weve created the worlds first Spam-detecting AI trained entirely in simulation and deployed on a physical robot. DATE: Sat, 01 Apr 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Evolution strategies as a scalable alternative to reinforcement learning DESCRIPTION: Weve discovered that evolution strategies (ES), an optimization technique thats been known for decades, rivals the performance of standard reinforcement learning (RL) techniques on modern RL benchmarks (e.g. Atari/MuJoCo), while overcoming many of RLs inconveniences. DATE: Fri, 24 Mar 2017 GMT --- TITLE: One-shot imitation learning DATE: Tue, 21 Mar 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Distill DESCRIPTION: Were excited to support todays launch of Distill, a new kind of journal aimed at excellent communication of machine learning results (novel or existing).

In this post well show how adversarial examples work across different mediums, and will discuss why securing systems against them can be difficult. DATE: Fri, 24 Feb 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Adversarial attacks on neural network policies DATE: Wed, 08 Feb 2017 GMT --- TITLE: Team update DESCRIPTION: The OpenAI team is now 45 people. Together, were pushing the frontier of AI capabilitieswhether by validating novel ideas, creating new software systems, or deploying machine learning on robots.
