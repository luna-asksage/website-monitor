The issue flagged a product announcement (Prism workspace) as relevant when it's a ChatGPT-tier consumer/business product, not an API or developer offering. When releases mention availability through "ChatGPT Business, Enterprise, or Education plans" or describe "workspaces" and "collaboration tools" without API endpoints, SDK updates, or developer documentation, they are consumer products. DO watch for API access details, SDK releases, or developer documentation mentions. DO NOT flag products that are only available through ChatGPT subscription tiers or described as end-user workspaces/applications.
